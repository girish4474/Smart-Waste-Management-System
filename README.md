# IoT based Smart-Waste-Management-System

Waste management is one of the primary problems that the world is facing from the past years. Many times, in our city or our surroundings we see that the garbage bins or dustbins placed at public places are overloaded. It brings out a bad smell and an unhygienic condition for the people living in that area. The proposed idea of Smart Bin helps in overcoming all those problems related to waste management.

This project displays an end-to-end application (focusing on the software part due to lack of availability of hardware parts)which tracks the level of trash in the smart bin and notifies the concerned authority regarding the status of the bin along with its location. The notification allows the concerned trash collector to come and collect the trash from the bin. 
	A mobile application is developed as a part of this project which connects to the cloud and displays all the necessary information of the bins in the application to the concerned administrator.
